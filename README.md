This is really bad code don't judge me

## But seriously
This is a "I'm bored" project and I'm not putting too much effort into it. 

At some point it might end up running on one of the like, bajillion raspberry pis I have lying around behind a reverse proxy and Dynamic DNS so that I 
can control it from a (likely equally badly coded) webapp on my phone. 

## PRs, issues, whatever
Have a PR? Do the thing!

Have an issue? I don't care!

Want to use my code? MIT license bro, do whatever you want.
